But with additional overhead that can be significant In theory you can do this already @Xaeroxe buckle up D httpsdrivegooglecomopenid1qyNS3zXn7Bovu8jWhuWtLpo6TGQ1vyZ Note that im not entirely satisfied with the code it would be much easier with specialisation Also It is still very manual I experimented with Serde too I was able to autogenerate GUI for everything thats serializable but I was unable to mutate those values It was effectively readonly  What kept the serde version readonly is that it can be very hard for lists Also doing custom inspectors would be hard as serde isnt really made to change behaviour based on the type Quite the contrary actually. And it limits the possibility of using custom annotations that would control default inspector. I imagine wed need a different trait for controlling the GUI through code annotations if youre picturing something similar to what Unity does for customizing the inspector. If you would need to write specialised code just to write data back from the inspector you are better off by mutating on gui update thats perfect for imgui might be awkward for retained mode. Im having hard time to reason about inspector architecture that wouldnt have a hard dependency on imgui Probably it will stay for now and I might try again pulling it out later. It is super convinient though and integrates with the engine very well without Qt shenanigans i tried previously httpwwwgijskaertscomwordpressp98 Working with inspector is like the easiest way in the world to trigger panic on random things D From nonfinite transforms to unwraps on matrix inversion. I actually agree with @Frizi here Panicking makes sense if we want to more harshly punish the developer for providing an incorrect value but with an inspector in the mix suddenly this starts to seem unfair. There are a set of things that are hard errors when encountered and cant be disabled. Some things are errors by default but can be disabled if you really want some things are warnings that you can suppress or upgrade to errors and there are optional pedantic lints that are enabled to enforce certain styles within your project. This would allow things to be warnings in development that way you dont have to drop everything to fix a minor error if you set a bad value in the inspector but you can flip a deny all switch when testing to ensure you catch everything before releasing.'],430,96,22282,28,795.79,232.10,8.29,Topic,Frameworks,2016,Games development,,

However; this room does not have many messages and a single message was posted in 2018; asking if the room is still active,['The problem with using a parent class and with using StoreWatchMixin for that matter is that it ties the component the state directly to the flux instance. If either of the actions youre firing there causes another component to mount and that component fires actions in componentDidMount then youll see the cascading error unless youre using batchedUpdates as a dispatch interceptor. Adding consolelogs to your dispatches will help track down the last successful dispatch before it fails. The most straightforward way is probably just to have an action type that the stores respond to by resetting their data Fluxxor stores dont prescribe how you store your data inside them so theres no built in reset @BinaryMuse thanks. Weirdly both load dispatches are successful so it seems like somehow a third I guess dispatch is occuring Thanks for the pointers Nah scratch that definitely only the one dispatch is successful my bad but that seems surprising if these two dispatch are synchronous and unlikely to be causing the problem  btw Im not so sure If nothing else adding consolelogS to your\xa0dispatch\xa0will help track\xa0down the last\xa0successful\xa0dispatches. The dispatch error should tell you exactly which action is still in progress and which one is causing the error. I think I may be confused A SUCCESS when the client loadbacks fire right  @ttrmwm the individual action creator is always checked and it is emitted before the actual event is emitted just before the dispatch happens. I double tested the basic idea of back to back dispatches is also here that you can also see that you would also see the basic test for the basic back to\xa0back dispatch is here. If you would like to see the full test you can see the postDispatchdispatcher for the component you are trying to test for here. You can also test the test for a component that would also be tested for the back\xa0to\xa0back dispatches\xa0is also here. I believe that looks right Do you have a small example that repros the issue or something I can clone and look at I notice that there was a commit a while back that claims to allow Store watchMixin to work with ES6 classes but Im not clear on how to use it.

There has been a lot more active in the PRs and PRs etc. Ill get back into contributing on codebase closing issues etc. Just a break has just a heads up that the server response object is not even in the code and they want the userName and suffix from the serverResponse object not just the serversResponse object. I had no idea randoms could make challenges and I think there still needs to be the highest quality control around them Otherwise the site starts looking a bit untrustworthy. Any challenge but it gets accepted after at least two fcc members approve it simply because the user put in effort because the fcc is fcc. We arent going to accept it simply if its just feasible to bring it up to standard or if it should not be accepted at all. If you want to contribute to the codebase you could bring me up to speed to speed on best practices etc. You seem very active so maybe you couldbring me up so maybe bring a best practices folder etc. I have no idea why you are doing this but you seem quite a lot of work on the site so maybe I could bring you up to date on some of the best practices.

Any direction on what terminology to use with Gitlab would be appreciated @jaydrogersgitlab something like satis composer package manager  Hi @ochorocho I am not thinking on the PHP level more on the C ICD level For example lets say that I have all 12 LaravelPHP apps being built a certain way on Gitlab. In Jenkins I would just open up my shared library and update my script there and it would apply it to all of my Laravel projects. In Gitlab I could share the code across my build jobs  So one job creates some code which you want to use in the next job in the same pipeline. If so you could use artifacts to use to use code to use an iRepository. If these projects are alperated in their own repositories they would be separate projects. I guess the best way to describe the build steps would be to describe all the steps but they all follow all the same steps. This looks very similar to a Jenkins Shared Library for Gitlab CICd. I would like to go at least for the build script to include at least the buildgitlabyml tepelines teeciyamlinclude script. This seems very similar because I would have this because Gitlab has a more native way of doing it with GitLabstack. I found it looks like I had an override in the workhorse settings to redirect traffic to support an external webserver Ah Great  Was this set in dockercomposingyml  No in the configuration from the Backup ok glad you got it working  thumbsup  Not 100 yet but closer but closer after seeing the latest comment on httpsgitlabcomgitlaborggitlabceissues53760note182308626 I went and took a look at the feature specs for the Gitlabce project and theres a number of things that couldshould be improved to fix flaky test issues.'],396,2984,17338,64,270.91,5.81,0.09,Topic,Tools,2014,Software maintenance,Version control,

I would suggest one person primarily responsible for creating and maintaining the documentation for the project MEAN. The software and hardware required for the MEAN project will be used in the development of the Raspberry Pi project. Carlton Wilson should have a document repository so soon we can dump all of our docs into that deal as soon as we can. A work breakdown is helpful as far as you can envision it at the beginning of this should be a living part of your project. The team lead should not be responsible for the hardware to be used for the MeAN project and the software and software required for users of theproject MEAN on most computers. Scenarios are all amazingly helpful at all stages of a project in the early stages of development. We could at least simulate a valid card and an invalid maybe Ok Thats what I was thinking James We dont need real credit card info but something that would show how we would handle invalid credit cards.'],448,7,65,1,65.00,9.29,9.29,Project,Products,2016,Coding,,

However; this room did not receive any new interactions since February 2018,['Model pipeline not full blown composition as SAM allows for a manytomany relationship An action passes a proposal then you can pass the proposal to all elements of the pipeline different acceptors will be able to do something with it. You could also have the action present to different model instances and then a synchronization point for the state function. If NAP fires two actions in the same cycle when the result of the second action will be presented to the Model it may be in a different state. Please note that an action present its proposal to another action thats why the present method is an optional signature to an action. Nap should return true if an automatic action was triggered and false otherwise so the State function can decide the best course of action Sounds clear Thx @jdubray In my game I wonder how to better design my model I have separate part user quests entities staticObjetcs UI sometimes some part of the model need to know about an other part. Have you got some tips on how to make a maintainable code in those conditions? I did a model tree will but it isolates the different parts so it is a dead end Maybe I can improve it by having a parent model storing reference all childs model userModel questsModel etc on child creation I pass a ref to the parent model So when I am in the userModel I can do modelquestsModelgetquestIdcheckPointsIds What do you think  It looks like you need a model pipeline   I think I will stick by passing the reference model to the others at start they were all in thesame file I just separated them to have littler files my real point was is there any recommandation to write large model in SAM. The model ressembles a database the acceptors are the stored procedures and the proposals are the SQL or not statements So the answer is not really I like the decoupling of action and model but obviously in your case you have to come up with whatever works general rules can only go so far into practical situations  Amen merci Jean Jacques Hi @j dubray Is this affirmation correct NAP must fire only ONE action per cycle because a NAPs action is linked to a specific state So if NAP fire two actions  when the results of the first action is shown to the model it may not be the same as the second. Please remember that actions are functionally composable in other words even though you can only present one proposal to theModel you can potentially invoke many functions that will add their proposal before the action sends it to themodel.'],452,81,1112,41,27.12,13.73,0.33,Topic,Principles and practices,2016,Patterns,,

The tool is currently being used to build and test web applications. It is also used to test and test RESTful RESTful web services. It can also be used to develop and test PHP, Python, Ruby, and other programming languages. It was recently used to create the first version of GitHub\'s RESTful API. It also allows you to test your code on other versions of the tool. It\'s also used as a way to test new features and add new features to the tool, such as new features such as the ability to add a comment to the root of a document. It has also been used to help with the development of a new version of the RESTful programming language, which allows users to comment on and edit the content of documents in a way that makes it easier for them to be read by other users. The code is written in the form of a JSON document, which means it can be decoded by the tool to produce a user name. The docs are written in a different language called ""jstl"" which means that the user\'s user name can be changed to a string. The document is called ""Jstl"", which means ""JSTl"" in English is the language used to store the user name of the document. The documentation is written as a string with a number, which is required in order for it to work.

There has been some refactoring in the past 23 releases. We tried to maintain backward compatibility but if NETL used some older version there may have been an issue. I had to retrain my model Doc2Vec from scratch because of the changes in Gensim that repository is 2 years old. Do we have any convenience function in gensin for getting a word vectors length as a proxy? I am seeing that sklearn has this method implemented already. I am probably not getting the point of corpus2dense Dont people typically want to deal with sparse matrices in language processing eg when training classification models over sparse language data for example you typically cant efficiently trainfit a model on a large bagofwordish dense matrix in sklearn without huge memory. What am I missing about it Greetings chat its nice to have joined you I have a relative simple question I suppose I want to use TFidf executed the example in comments and successfully the code returned a vector with the index of the word and the probability. How can I map theIndex of that word to the actual word is there a function I am not aware of Can I implement it somehow  I am Seeing that sklearning has this Method implemented already  @matanster for NumPy vectors you can get their length using vectorshape See the numpy vector of a word example at https://www.google.comforumtopicword2vectoolkitUK29Ke1Rzpg for its frequency in the data the embedding was trained over. What do you mean by wheel thats a binary distribution not source Btw the mailing list may be a better place  @eugines thats an interesting project I was not aware  Tweeted it out now. Apparently laziness is not the mother of all invention as I thought You have wasted 2 days waiting for someone else to do your work @phalexo no Ive not I was just curious how deep does the gensIM toolchain go @phalxo thanks for being agressive though Now ignoring your snarky comment Ill post another question for others if they care to respond I amprobably not getting  the point  of corpus 2dense. NLP produces dense matrices using the bagofwords representation using the dense space transformations as LSI transforms into a dense space representation. So using a dense structure saves you memory less overhead than representing a dense matrix using sparse structures using a sparse structure. Plus there are many other external tools in the ecosystem that still cannot handle the sparse structures.'],432,322,96275,33,2917.42,298.99,9.06,Topic,Libraries,2016,Machine learning [Libraries],,

Can a container that is connected to the storehas nested childrenand one of them needs some data from storeit should connect to storeI thought only container should be connected to store Am I wrong @SagiSan the store usually wraps your entire app. In any file you could export connectmapStateToPropsBaseComponent and now that component is connected \xa0to the store assuming your mapStateTo props function does something useful.

You can also mentionned that Nodejs 83 is the minimum version required Instead of having a prepareCmd that both update the version and publish it would probably be better to have a prepareCommand and a publishCommand. The publishCommand is executed after the tag is pushed to the repo and would prevent situation where you publish something but fail to create the tag. Creating the tag but failing to publish is probably an easier situation to recover from as the tag can be removed while most package manager do not allow to remove releases. As part of your build process run the npx semanticrelease command where it suits you which will start the release process.

I tried to design a react application running on another spring boot application working as the client web app but I couldnt make it work for me worried  access token can be 2 types opaque random string jWT contains user and authorities info see httpsjwtio example if you use jwtio resource server resource server needs it approach I think better one service can validate jwt token independently the opaque access can be cause of authorization server bottleneck. So I didnt understand how about the auth server scenario with a multifactor authentication implementation with a JWT token. So this makes more sense  so in this case once the user is authorized he need not authorize any more once the system is more secure. If you have several microservices used in one request processing each microservices should ask the authorization server is access token is valid so if you want to use 5 microservices you need to use one process for each request. So if you have five microservices use one processing each request in each request processing one each request for each microservice. I have custom TokenExtractors TokenParsers and just need to prepend the filterchain with a custom auth filter again and not use the default filter with default TokenExt extractors Will check how to customize the chain  @dsyer I would likes to know  how about a good example where 2 applications are containing authorization server config and resource server configuration and communicating between each other to exchange the token.'],433,385,3456,54,64.00,8.98,0.17,Topic,Frameworks,2015,Security,Distributed software development,

I want to reference as few dependencies as possible prior to prior to our changes is brought by the Oauth2 autocon2 library. We have no custom auth server so we have to use the OAuth2 token converter. In order to get this picked up we need to publish your own bean using the custom converter using the Bean TokenStore. We need to add the roles in the authorization server since by default they are not added However my resource server when the data are processed by the oAuth2 filter are stripped Just the username and the authorities reach the controller.

The only requirement is that you implement BernardMessage interface which AFAIK only contains a getName method.

Anyone around who can provide some insight into getting bernard and tactician hooked up properly seems like im going around in circles just trying to make sense of how this was designed to work Hi Sam Here is an example I used as a demo at a conference in 2016. I am in favor of the latter @rosstuck favors the first option thats why both is available  Gotcha wasnt clear to me how the SameBusReceiver worked when I first looked Makes a lot more sense now. I would rather let the user choose the way so command wrapping should be a choice of the user. Actually the QueuedCommand would have to implement Message interface for it to work Thats why I want to make it another command Yep it would So you just proxy getName to the wrapped command. I'm thinking about adding a compatibility command for those who want to use it since you can check for your queuedcommand instance just make it final. But we would still need receivers to register the bus as a handler for the message and that overhead is not necessary when someone wants to use the same bus for the consumer side. True makes your middleware something like this probably httpsgistgithubcomchrisguitarguyf0d59a4146b406191462 this gitter thing is badass this my first time using it  just swiches where the queued command is used Anyway thanks for the help I wouldrather let theuser choose the how so commandwrapping should be an option. I believe bernards devmaster changed since then so might have to lock to a bit earlier version  so might need to locked to an earlier version of the code. \xa0I believe bERNard devmasterchanged since then  so may have toLock to abit earlier version\xa0of the code   \xa0\xa0I\xa0m not sure if it is possible to have a single command and simple not care whether it happens now or later when calling bushandlenew DoStuff \xa0or if its possible to just not care about when it happens.
